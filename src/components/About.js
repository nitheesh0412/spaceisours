<p>For those in the path of destruction when natural disasters strike, everything changes. People are often left homeless and hungry, separated from their families, and their savings are washed away.  Schools and medical facilities are closed, and help is often delayed. The list goes on. Recent experiences with superstorms, wildfires, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions demonstrate just how destructive natural disasters can be. We are working to understand how climate change might worsen the impact of some of these natural disasters.</p>

                    <p>When it comes to natural disasters, the world needs vulnerability assessments to build more resilient communities, early warning systems to get people out of harmâ€™s way, and near real-time access to data and mapping capabilities to inform disaster response. NASA can support organizations with the information they need to successfully improve efforts on all these fronts.</p>
